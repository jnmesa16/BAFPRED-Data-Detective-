# BAFPRED-Data-Detective-
Data Detective Hunt: Crack the Code! is an interactive analytics game where players upload, clean, and visualize basketball data to uncover the team with the most wins in 2019. They build a predictive model to forecast game outcomes and solve the mystery, practicing data analysis skills throughout the game.

Throughout the game, you’ll work with real-world data and apply analytical techniques to crack the case.

Task 1: Upload the Dataset
The game starts by uploading a dataset that contains basketball team performance data. This gives you an overview of the data you'll be working with throughout the game.

Task 2: Clean the Data
The next step is to clean the data. You’ll check for any missing or incomplete information in the dataset. The game gives you two options to handle missing values: you can either remove rows with missing data or fill in the gaps with the mean of the column. This task ensures the dataset is ready for analysis.

Task 3: Visualize the Data
Once the data is cleaned, you’ll focus on analyzing the 2019 season. You’ll create visualizations that show how teams performed based on the number of games won. This will give you insights into the overall performance of each team during that year.

Task 4: Build a Predictive Model
In this task, you’ll build a predictive model using machine learning. You’ll use a linear regression model to predict the number of games won based on the points scored by each team. You’ll train the model, test it, and evaluate its performance by calculating its mean squared error.

Final Task: Solve the Mystery
After completing all tasks, you’ll be asked the ultimate question: Which team won the most games in 2019? If you answer correctly, the mystery is solved, and you’ll complete the game with your detective skills intact!
